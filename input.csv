To be or not to be--that is the question:--\cf0 \
 \cf2 Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer\cf0 \
 \cf2 The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune\cf0 \
 \cf2 Or to take arms against a sea of troubles\cf0 \
 \cf2 And by opposing end them?--To die--to sleep--\cf0 \
 \cf2 No more; and by a sleep to say we end\cf0 \
 \cf2 The heartache and the thousand natural shocks\cf0 \
 \cf2 That flesh is heir to--'tis a consummation\cf0 \
 \cf2 Devoutly to be wish'd. To die--to sleep;--\cf0 \
 \cf2 To sleep! perchance to dream:--ay there's the rub;\cf0 \
 \cf2 For in that sleep of death what dreams may come\cf0 \
 \cf2 When we have shuffled off this mortal coil\cf0 \
 \cf2 Must give us pause: there's the respect\cf0 \
 \cf2 That makes calamity of so long life;\cf0 \
 \cf2 For who would bear the whips and scorns of time\cf0 \
 \cf2 The oppressor's wrong the proud man's contumely\cf0 \
 \cf2 The pangs of despis'd love the law's delay\cf0 \
 \cf2 The insolence of office and the spurns\cf0 \
 \cf2 That patient merit of the unworthy takes\cf0 \
 \cf2 When he himself might his quietus make\cf0 \
 \cf2 With a bare bodkin? who would these fardels bear\cf0 \
 \cf2 To grunt and sweat under a weary life\cf0 \
 \cf2 But that the dread of something after death--\cf0 \
 \cf2 The undiscover'd country from whose bourn\cf0 \
 \cf2 No traveller returns--puzzles the will\cf0 \
 \cf2 And makes us rather bear those ills we have\cf0 \
 \cf2 Than fly to others that we know not of?\cf0 \
 \cf2 Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;\cf0 \
 \cf2 And thus the native hue of resolution\cf0 \
 \cf2 Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought;\cf0 \
 \cf2 And enterprises of great pith and moment\cf0 \
 \cf2 With this regard their currents turn awry\cf0 \
 \cf2 And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!\cf0 \
 \cf2 The fair Ophelia!--Nymph in thy orisons\cf0 \
 \cf2 Be all my sins remember'd.}
